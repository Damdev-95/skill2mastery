## Installing Terraform: A Simple Setup
Getting Terraform up and running is like setting up a new smartphone â€“ it's straightforward and doesn't take much time. 
Here's a step-by-step guide to installing Terraform:

- Go to the official Terraform website and download the appropriate version of Terraform for your operating system.
- Unzip the downloaded file in the directory where Terraform will live. Additionally, place the Terraform binary file in a directory that is included in your system's PATH environment variable. For a more detailed explanation, see this official documentation.
- Open your terminal or command prompt and enter the command terraform -help to verify that Terraform has been installed correctly.
- Configure your Terraform settings by creating a configuration file (usually named "main.tf") that specifies the resources you want to manage with Terraform.
- Run the command terraform init in the directory where your main configuration file is located. This will initialize your Terraform working directory and download any necessary plugins.
- Once initialization is complete, run the command terraform plan to see a preview of the changes that will be made to your infrastructure.
- Finally, run the command terraform apply to apply the changes to your infrastructure.

## Components of Terraform

# Providers

Providers are plugins for Terraform that define which cloud or service platform you're working with

# Variables 

Terraform variables are used to parameterize your configuration.

```hcl
variable "region" {
  description = "AWS region"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"
}

```
# Reference structure

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

```


# Resouce

# Data Sources

Data sources allow Terraform to read information from outside Terraform-managed infrastructure (e.g., existing AWS resources).

```hcl
data "aws_ami" "latest_amazon_linux" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
  }

  owners = ["amazon"]
}

```

```hcl
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

output "account_id" {
  value = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
}
```

# Outputs

Outputs display information after Terraform execution, such as IPs, resource IDs, or config values.

```hcl
output "bucket_name" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.bucket
}
```



## Combine together

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

variable "region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}

data "aws_ami" "amazon_linux" {
  most_recent = true
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
  }
  owners = ["amazon"]
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "WebInstance"
  }
}

output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.web.id
}

```
