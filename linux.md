(a) Hardware Layer

ðŸ”¹ The physical components of the computer (CPU, RAM, disk, network interfaces, etc.).
ðŸ”¹ The OS interacts with hardware using device drivers.
(b) Kernel (Core of Linux OS)

ðŸ”¹ The Linux Kernel is responsible for directly managing system resources, including:

    Process Management â€“ Schedules processes and handles multitasking.

    Memory Management â€“ Allocates and deallocates RAM efficiently.

    Device Drivers â€“ Acts as an interface between software and hardware.

    File System Management â€“ Manages how data is stored and retrieved.

    Network Management â€“ Handles communication between systems.

(c) Shell (Command Line Interface - CLI)

ðŸ”¹ A command interpreter that allows users to interact with the kernel.
ðŸ”¹ Examples: Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash, Ksh.
ðŸ”¹ Converts user commands into system calls for the kernel.
(d) User Applications

ðŸ”¹ End-user programs like web browsers, text editors, DevOps tools, etc.
ðŸ”¹ Applications interact with the OS using system calls via the shell or GUI.

## Distributions
```

Ubuntu â€“ One of the most beginner-friendly distros, widely used for personal and server use. It has great community support.

CentOS (discontinued, replaced by AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux) â€“ Previously a popular choice for servers, based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

Debian â€“ A very stable and reliable distro, often used as a base for other distros like Ubuntu.

Fedora â€“ A cutting-edge distro that introduces new features before they reach RHEL.

Arch Linux â€“ A lightweight, rolling-release distro for advanced users who like customization.

Kali Linux â€“ Designed for cybersecurity and penetration testing.

Alpine Linux â€“ A lightweight, security-focused distro often used in containers.

## Package Manager
* APT (Debian, Ubuntu)

```
sudo apt update         # Update package lists
sudo apt upgrade -y     # Upgrade installed packages
sudo apt install nginx  # Install a package
sudo apt remove nginx   # Remove a package
sudo apt autoremove     # Remove unused dependencies
sudo apt search nginx   # Search for a package
```

* DNF (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS)

```
sudo dnf check-update   # Check for updates
sudo dnf update         # Update all packages
sudo dnf install nginx  # Install a package
sudo dnf remove nginx   # Remove a package
```

## Best Practices for Using Package Managers

* Always update your package list before installing software:
`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`

* Use autoremove to clean up unused dependencies:
`sudo apt autoremove`
